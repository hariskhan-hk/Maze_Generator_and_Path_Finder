# Maze_Generator_and_Path_Finder

This project implements a Maze Generator using a randomized depth-first search algorithm and a Path Finder with the A algorithm*, all visualized using Python and Pygame. Users can customize maze dimensions, and the program generates a dynamic maze and calculates the optimal path in real-time.

Key Features:

• Customizable maze dimensions

• Real-time maze generation and pathfinding visualization

• A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding

Potential future updates include adding more maze generation algorithms and advanced heuristics.
